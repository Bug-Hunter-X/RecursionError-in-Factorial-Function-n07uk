This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions in Python: forgetting to handle negative input values. The `factorial_bug.py` file contains the buggy code, while `factorial_solution.py` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises because the recursive call never stops when a negative number is passed, leading to a `RecursionError`. The solution adds a check to handle negative input gracefully.
